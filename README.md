# CoARCT
Code Analysis and Refactoring with Clang Tools

(Note Clang-5.0 branch now available.)

CoARCT (pronounced like the word "corked") is a small set of tools built on Clang's LibTooling. CoARCT demonstrates some more sustained examples of refactoring and analyzing code with AST Matchers and the clang Refactoring Tool.

It includes library codeÂ and command line drivers that go beyond some of the (excellent!) tutorials that are available. The CoARCT examples are drawn from refactoring legacy codes:
* Reporting which functions use which global variables;
* Replacing global variables with local variables, including threading variables through a call chain;
* Detecting which functions use which fields of a struct: this data can be used to analyze how to break up large structs;
* Finding code associated with a classic C-style linked list;
* Identifying struct fields defined with typedefs, reporting underlying types (apps/TypedefFinder.cc).

It also demonstrates a few useful things that were not immediately clear from the tutorials and examples I learned from, such as unit testing matchers and callbacks, and building out of the Clang/LLVM tree.

Our hope is that CoARCT will help demystify the Clang AST tools to developers. If the CoARCT tools are directly useful in your work, let us know!

## Prerequisites:
1. CMake version 3+ (https://cmake.org/download/)
2. Clang and LLVM libraries and headers (http://releases.llvm.org/download.html)
3. libtinfo
4. Boost (currently using 1.61, just needs boost/type_index in one spot)
4. Google test (https://github.com/google/googletest)

Works with Clang 4.0 (3.9, 3.8). NEW: 5.0 (see clang-5.0 branch.)

## Build

1. Define these environment variables
    ```
    GTEST_DIR: Top level directory of google test installation
    BOOST_DIR: Top level of Boost (#include "boost/type_index.hpp" needs to work)
    TINFO_LIB_DIR: points to where libtinfo.a is installed.
    LLVM_LIB_DIR: points to where LLVM libraries are installed (e.g. ${HOME}/llvm/clang+llvm-4.0.0-x86_64-apple-darwin/lib)
    CLANG_LIB_DIR: points to where Clang libraries are installed. (e.g. ${HOME}/llvm/clang+llvm-4.0.0-x86_64-apple-darwin/lib)
    LibClang_INCLUDE_DIR: where Clang headers reside (e.g. ${HOME}/llvm/clang+llvm-4.0.0-x86_64-apple-darwin/include)
    ```

2. Clone the repository
3. Create a build directory

    ```
    /home/CoARCT $ mkdir build-clang-4.0.0
    /home/CoARCT $ cd build-clang-4.0.0
    ```

4. Run cmake, make

    ```
    /home/CoARCT/build-clang-4.0.0 $ cmake ..
    /home/CoARCT/build-clang-4.0.0 $ make
    ```

5. Run the unit tests

    ```
    /home/CoARCT/build-clang-4.0.0 $ ./test/corct-unittests
    ...
    [==========] 76 tests from 14 test cases ran. (157 ms total)
    [  PASSED  ] 76 tests.
    ```

### Building on Ubuntu

Prajjwald reported some solutions to problems with building on Ubuntu. Please see [issue #1](https://github.com/lanl/CoARCT/issues/1).
